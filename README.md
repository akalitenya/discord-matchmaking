-   `knex migrate:latest`
-   (Optional) `knex seed:run` // To have some test data
-   `npm run watch` / `npm run build` to compile ts files
-   `npm run dev`
-   Your bot should be ready
-   Generate an invite to your desired channel:

Put this in the bottom of `index.ts`

```js
bot.getClient().on("ready", async () => {
    try {
        let link = await client.generateInvite(["ADMINISTRATOR"])
        console.log(link)
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(e.stack)
    }
})
```

(You can erase the code block when you are done with the invitation)

## Migrate & refresh

```bassh
knex migrate:rollback

knex migrate:latest

knex seed:run
```

## Utilities

Get latest server snapshot
`node dist/Utilities/getSnap.js`

Get server passwords
`node dist/Utilities/getPasswords.js {serverName}`

## [Migrations](http://knexjs.org/#Migrations)

Once you have finished writing the migrations, you can update the database matching your NODE_ENV by running:

`knex migrate:latest`

You can also pass the --env flag or set NODE_ENV to select an alternative environment:

`knex migrate:latest --env production`

To rollback the last batch of migrations:

`knex migrate:rollback`

`knex seed:run`

Refresh:

```
knex migrate:rollback
knex migrate:latest
knex seed:run
```

## Code Style

We run a precommit hook that executes Prettier.

However, if you want to force Prettier's execution you can do it like this:

`npx prettier --write src/**/*`
